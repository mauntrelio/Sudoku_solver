# Sudoku solver

A visual javascript Sudoku solver

## Story

Up to October 2019 I never solved a single Sudoku. Then I taught my 7 years old daughter what a Sudoku is and how to solve it. I also got engaged, but, after solving a bunch of Sudoku puzzles, I had to step further to get a computer to make it for me.

The algorithm to solve the puzzle in my code is for sure not the best, but I wanted basically to replicate on a GUI the method I was using when solving Sudoku puzzles manually, so here is the result after some evenings of coding.
